### 1.1 Business Objectives
- Automate SAP screenshot collection process
- Integrate cloud storage for output file management
- Enhance security through centralized file storage
- Reduce manual intervention in the file handling process
- Maintain compatibility with existing Windows-based systems

## 2. Business Context

### 2.1 Current State
- Existing Autonomous Config project operates in a network environment
- Manual .exe file upload process through intermediate channel
- Output files stored locally on client VM
- Windows-based execution environment
- VPN-protected client network

### 2.2 Desired Future State
- Automated output file upload to cloud storage
- Centralized file management and access
- Enhanced security through cloud storage integration
- Streamlined file retrieval process
